  # The simulation uses a virtual time. Please see README for more details.

  # A size of a message payload in bytes (e.g. the size of a block proposal)
  payload_size: 320
  # An interval of sending a new real/cover message
  # A probability of actually sending a message depends on the following parameters.
  message_interval: 1
  # A probability of sending a real message within a cycle
  real_message_prob: 0.1
  # A weight of real message emission probability of some nodes
  # Each weight is assigned to each node in the order of the node ID.
  # The length of the list should be <= p2p.num_nodes. i.e. some nodes won't have a weight.

  # A probability of sending a cover message within a cycle if not sending a real message
  cover_message_prob: 0.2
  # A maximum preparation time (delay) before sending the message
  max_message_prep_time: 0.3
  # A maximum delay of messages mixed in a mix node
  max_mix_delay: 3

  # A maximum network latency between nodes directly connected with each other

    # How many times in simulation represent 1 second in real time

adversary:
  # A discrete time window for the adversary to observe inputs and outputs of a certain node
